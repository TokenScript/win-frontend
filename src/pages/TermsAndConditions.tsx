          malfunction or human error has occurred. Our Website will subsequently be
          updated accordingly to reflect the accurate availability, information, and price

          3. Travel Documents
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
          3.1. Your Travel Document(s) will be delivered to you electronically to the
          email address provided by you at the time of your Booking. You acknowledge that
          it is your responsibility to ensure that the email address you provide is
          entered correctly and that you will immediately notify us where an error has
          been made on your part. We shall not be liable for any delay or failure to
          deliver your Travel Document(s) where the delay or failure was made on your

          4. Payments
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
          4.1. Your price will only be guaranteed once the Total Price for your Booking
          has been paid in full. In this regard, please be informed that taxes are subject
          to change and the tax is finalised when your Travel Document is issued. We also
          inform you that we are not subject to VAT, and consequently no VAT invoice will
          be issued to you following the successful completion of your Booking.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
          4.2. We only accept payment via selected cryptocurrencies. The Booking purchased
          with cryptocurrency will only be ticketed once the transaction has received one
          confirmation on the relevant blockchain. Bookings purchased with cryptocurrency
          are generally subject to miner fees, which are received by miners (or nodes)
          that confirm your transaction on the blockchain, not win.so. The miner fee
          applicable to your Booking will depend on network conditions and the miner fee
          selected by you at the time of the cryptocurrency transaction. Please further
          take note of our cryptocurrency refund policy in clause 8.5 herein.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
          4.3. We reserve the right to delegate the management of all or part of our
          electronic payment collection to third- party payment providers. Any fees
          incurred by you as a result of purchasing a Travel Product from us are
          non-refundable, subject to your rights under applicable law.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
          4.4. You acknowledge that any payments of the Total Price that you make are
          facilitated by third-party blockchain systems. We do not, at any point in time,
          have custody of or access to control the Final Price or any other payment. Any
          payments made by you are paid directly to the Accommodation Provider.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
          4.5. The currency rates displayed on the Website are not verified or guaranteed
          by us as being accurate and should be used as guidelines only. Rates are not
          guaranteed to be updated every day and actual rates may vary.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="h5" gutterBottom>
          5. Cancellations, Refunds and Changes
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
          5.1. When you cancel a reservation prior to check-in, the Accommodation Provider
          will determine whether you are entitled to receive a refund and, if so, the
          amount of the Total Price refundable to you shall be subject to the
          Accommodation Provider&#39;s cancellation policy. Please ensure that you read
          the cancellation policy applicable to your selected Travel Product carefully as
          the cancellation policy varies between Accommodation Providers and the
          respective Travel Products that are offered.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
          5.2. Where you cancel or are otherwise unable to attend a reservation due to a
          Force Majeure event, you may be entitled to receive a partial or full refund of
          your Total Price regardless of the Accommodation Provider&#39;s cancellation
          policy, as determined by the Accommodation Provider on a case-by-case basis.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
          5.3. Where an Accommodation Provider cancels a reservation, you may be entitled
          to receive a partial or full refund of your Total Price, depending on the
          Accommodation Provider&#39;s cancellation policy and rules. Please note that we
          are not liable for the consequences of any cancellations or changes made by the
          Accommodation Providers.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
          5.4. Where you request to make changes to a reservation, you acknowledge that
          the fulfilment of such changes is at the sole discretion of the Accommodation
          Provider and that the Accommodation Provider reserve the right to charge an
          additional fee to fulfil such changes.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
          5.5. If you are entitled to a refund, either in part or in full, the refund
          amount that you are entitled to will be processed upon our receipt of cleared
          funds from the Accommodation Provider. Where a refund is properly due to you and
          we have received your cancellation or amendment email, we will refund you within
          5 working days after we have received the applicable refund sum from the
          respective Accommodation Provider. You acknowledge that due to cryptocurrency
          price/value volatility and regulatory requirements, we are only able to refund
          cryptocurrency payments in part or in full with the same crypto-currency that
          was used for the booking.
